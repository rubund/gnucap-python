Three types of contributions make sense at the current stage

- more interface files
  swig interface headers have the same name as the gnucap headers, except they
  start with an extra underscore and end with .i. look at what is there,
  _m_wave.i is a good example.

  some of the interface files are incomplete, feel free to send patches, but
  not without

- tests
  a test consists of a pair of files. one is the script (here:*.gc or *.py),
  the other is the expected output (append .ref to the filename)

- examples/documentation
  it is possible to implement simulation commands or components in python.
  these can be shared in contrib.

plase make sure to include your name with a submission. contributions can be
made through any reasonable channel and must be licensed under GPLv3.
